## Disclaimer

> The purpose of this site is only to initiate the conversation to start a fablab in Prague. There is no organization or institution behind this work.

## Introduction

Prague needs a Fab Lab. A shared space for creators, designers, educators, and innovators to explore the future of local digital fabrication. A space connected to the international FabLab Network, importing and exporting information rather than products. Join the conversation and lets build an open inclusive Fab Lab to propell Prague into the revolution of personal digital fabrication. 

## Crowd Sourced

In the spirit of open making, this is an open initiative to crowd source a Fab Lab. This is the very beginning so reach out with any questions or proposals, a diverse skill set and passion for the maker movement and digital fabricatoin are welcome in this project!
