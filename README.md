# Fab Lab Prague

Prague needs a Fab Lab. A shared space for creators, designers, educators, and innovators to explore the future of local digital fabrication. A space connected to the international FabLab Network, importing and exporting information rather than products. Join the conversation and lets build an open inclusive Fab Lab to propell Prague into the revolution of personal digital fabrication.
